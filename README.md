# Features
The plugin is divided into three tabs: the slots tab, flipping tab and statistics tab. 

### The Flipping Tab
This tab displays info most relevant to you when actively flipping

</p>

The item cards are highly customizable, allowing you to pick what information to show in which section.

### The Statistics Tab
This tab records your trading history, down to every single individual offer you made.

</p>


#### Recipe flips

Sometimes, flips aren't straightforward selling and buying of the same item - they involve combining several items
into one or transforming an item into another. For accurately capturing the profits for these complicated trades, you
can create a "recipe flip".

Go to your offers for an item in the stats tab. If there is a recipe for that item, a recipe flip button will
be present on the offer card. Click it and select the appropriate recipe

</p>

adjust the inputs and outputs if necessary, then combine

<p align="center"> 
  <img src = "https://github.com/Flipping-Utilities/rl-plugin/blob/master/images/recipeCreationStep.png">

view your recipe flips in the "recipes" tab of the stats tab

## Additional Features

#### Slot timers

Slot timers help you figure out when you should cancel an offer. They show you how long it has been 
since the offer was last active.

#### Offer editors

The price and quantity help you set up your offers quickly!

#### Add untracked trades easily

Flip on mobile and have untracked trades? Just pop open your ge history and easily add untracked trades

# Development 

### General Structure of Codebase

This section will talk about the purpose of various parts of the codebase, specifically the folders.

**controller/**
- This folder contains the components that handle some specific responsibility of the plugin, mainly by handling runelite 
  events (such as new GE offers) or presenting APIs to alter/view user data. Each class in this folder is instantiated 
  by the FlippingPlugin in its constructor, which is run on client startup. Each of these classes handles a specific 
  responsibility of the plugin. For example, the NewOfferEventPipelineHandler is responsible for consuming new offer 
  events and adding it to the data structures that model user trade history. The classes are used via the FlippingPlugin 
  calling their methods, for example, when the FlippingPlugin gets an offer event in the onGrandExchangeOfferChanged 
  method it calls `newOfferEventPipelineHandler.onGrandExchangeOfferChanged(newOffer);`.
  Much of the logic in these controller classes used to live in the FlippingPlugin class but was moved out as the 
  FlippingPlugin class had become huge and was doing too many things.
  
  
**model/**
- This folder contains the classes that represent the data that will be stored on disk. These classes are turned into 
  JSON and saved to disk and are also created from JSON that was previously saved to disk. To see what each of these
  classes actually model, check out the [Data model](#Data-model) section.
  
  
**db/**
- This folder contains the class responsible for taking the models and saving them
to disk as JSON. It also loads JSON from disk (previously saved) and turns them into objects.
  
**ui/**
- This folder contains all of the UI code for the plugin which is the code that draws the "plugin" you see, such as the slots 
tab, the flipping tab, the statistics tab, and all of the content within them. 
  
**jobs/**
- This folder contains code that is running in background threads to periodically performing some action, such as the 
  code that queries the wiki to get the new prices of items, or the code that sends premium users' slots to our api.
  
**utilities/**
- Just random code that doesn't fit neatly into any of the categories above. 

### Example Flow

This section will give an example of how the plugin actually runs, what happens during its lifetime, how the different 
components interact with each other, and how the data flows.

The starting point to this plugin is the FlippingPlugin class. On Runelite startup, the Runelite code will create an 
instance of the FlippingPlugin class and then call its `startUp()` method.

#### On Runelite Client Startup
The FlippingPlugin does three main things on startup (all in the `startUp()` method):
1. It creates instances of all the controller classes, described in the controller section of [General Structure of Codebase](#General-structure-of-codebase)
2. It initializes the various UI classes such as the FlippingPanel and StatsPanel. This will result in the UI being
drawn eventually.
3. It loads the user's previously saved trading history from the disk via one of the controller classes, the DataHandler

Now things have been setup properly and the UI has been drawn and populated with the user's previously saved data from
disk.

#### During Runelite Client's Lifetime
During the lifetime of the Runelite Client (between startup and shutdown), there are primarily three ways the plugin does work
1. **Handling Runelite events that reflect some change of state in the game**. There are many different Runelite events. For example, 
   events can trigger in various scenarios: when an account logs in, a GE offer gets placed, an account logs out, 
   an account opens the GE interace, and many more. The Runelite code will feed the plugin these events if the plugin implements certain methods. For example, 
   when the user places an offer in the GE, Runelite code gives the plugin details of the GE offer event via calling the 
   `onGrandExchangeOfferChanged` on the FlippingPlugin class and passing that method a `GrandExchangeOfferChanged` object.
   It knows to do this because of method naming conventions. You don't have to define a method to handle every possible 
   type of Runelite event, just the ones your plugin should care about.
2. **Handling UI interactions that the user initiates**. For example, the user may want to see data for another account, so
   he clicks on the account dropdown selector and selects another account. The plugin then needs to re-render its UI with the 
   selected account's trades.
3. **Via background threads that are performing some action periodically**. See the jobs section of [General Structure of Codebase](#general-structure-of-codebase).


#### On Runelite Client Shutdown
The runelite client will tell the plugin when its shutting down and will allow it to execute some code before
that happens. This occurs in `onClientShutdown` in the FlippingPlugin class. Not much happens other than saving 
user data to disk and cancelling any background jobs that were running.


### Data model

This section describes how the plugin models users' trade history. The main model classes used to do this are:
AccountData, FlippingItem, HistoryManager, and OfferEvent.

When you go to `.runelite/flipping/<username>.json` and open it, you will see the JSON version of an AccountData
object. Each of the user's osrs accounts get their own AccountData object, each of which is stored in a file
of the format `.runelite/flipping/<account_username>.json`. 

AccountData objects are created from the JSON in those files on client startup (or created on account login if they have
no previously saved data for that account). As the user makes trades, deletes trades via the UI, and so on, the 
AccountData object for the correct account is mutated. Then, on account logout or client shutdown, it is turned back 
into JSON and saved into the same file it was loaded from (or creates a new file if there was no previously saved data).

The AccountData object's most important field is `List<FlippingItem> trades`. This field contains FlippingItem objects.
FlippingItem objects have an itemId (every runescape item has a unique number to identify it) and represents the trade history
for that item on that account. So, for example, if you flipped dragon claws on an account, you would have one and only one 
FlippingItem in that account's AccountData object that holds all the buy and sell offers you have ever made for dragon 
claws on that account. 

The FlippingItem stores all the offers for that item in the `HistoryManager history` field. Put simply, a HistoryManager
is just a list of OfferEvent. An OfferEvent represents a buy and sell offer in which some amount of an
item bought or sold. It has various fields like price, quantity, etc.
